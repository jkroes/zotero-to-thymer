# Zotana — project guide

Zotero 7 plugin that live-syncs library items into Tana as structured reference
nodes, updating **in place** on re-sync. Fork of
[Notero](https://github.com/dvanoni/notero) with the Notion layer replaced by
Tana's **Local API**. User-facing overview and setup are in `README.md`.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build         # one-off esbuild → build/
pnpm start         # launch Zotero with the plugin (see zotero.config.json)
pnpm test          # vitest
pnpm typecheck     # tsc
pnpm create-xpi    # repackage build/ into xpi/ (build only compiles to build/)
```

`vp check` = format + lint + types (whole repo); `vp run verify` adds tests. The
`check`/`verify` scripts pass `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` so `pnpm check
<path>` tolerates a non-lintable path (e.g. a `.md`); bare `vp check <path>`
without that flag errors with "Linting could not start / No files found to lint".

Release workflow (green-first, then tag; never move a published version tag) is
in `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## After pushing: watch CI to green

Two git hooks (husky, auto-installed by the `prepare` script) front-run CI:

- **pre-commit** (`.husky/pre-commit` → lint-staged) runs `vp fmt` on staged
  source/doc files, so formatting is auto-fixed before it's committed.
- **pre-push** (`.husky/pre-push`) runs `pnpm verify && pnpm build` — the same
  gate as CI's Build job (format + lint + types, tests, then esbuild build). A
  failing push is blocked locally, so CI rarely surprises you. Bypass with
  `git push --no-verify` for WIP.

The **Build** workflow re-runs `vp run verify` + build on a clean machine as the
source of truth. After any push, watch it through to completion and don't
consider the work done until it's green:

```sh
gh run watch $(gh run list --branch main --workflow Build --limit 1 \
  --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId') --exit-status
```

If Build fails, read the failed step and act on the _kind_ of failure:

- **Real code/format failure** (e.g. `vp check` formatting, failing test, type
  error, build error): fix it locally, verify with `pnpm verify`, commit, push,
  and watch again.
- **Transient infra failure** (e.g. `actions/checkout` "Repository not found",
  network/runner blips — the job dies before `vp run verify`): don't change code.
  Re-run the same run with `gh run rerun <run-id>` and watch again.

Repeat until Build is green. Only then is the change actually verified — and only
a green `main` is eligible to be tagged for release (see `docs/RELEASING.md`).

## Architecture

Source lives under `src/content/`.

- **`tana/client.ts`** — thin REST client for the Tana Local API (injected
  `fetch` + Bearer token). `health`, `import`, `setFieldContent` (accepts `null`
  to clear), `setFieldOption`, `setTags`, `trash`, `readNode`, `search`,
  `update` (flat `{name?, description?}`), `getChildren` (a node's direct children
  — used to locate the `Annotations` field tuple), and schema ops `listWorkspaces`,
  `listWorkspaceTags`, `createTag`, `addField`, `getTagSchema`.
- **`tana/constants.ts`** — the field `CATALOG` (per field: `key`,
  `defaultName`, `dataType`, `multiValue`, `transientSeed`, …). **No hardcoded
  attribute/tag IDs.** `CATALOG` is ordered alphabetically by `defaultName` and
  is the single source of truth for that order (drives the prefs table, stored
  config, and field-creation order). `effectiveFieldName(key, name)` resolves a
  blank configured name to the catalog default. `ENTITY_TAG_NAMES` /
  `ANNOTATION_TAG_NAMES` are the **default** (user-overridable) names for the aux
  supertags; `ENTITY_TAG_KEYS` / `ANNOTATION_TAG_KEYS` are typed key tuples for
  iterating them.
- **`tana/schema.ts`** — `ensureSchema(client, config, {workspaceId,
optionSeeds})`: finds the reference tag and the aux tags (Person / Organization /
  highlight / comment / image) **by their configured names** (`config.entityTags`
  / `config.annotationTags`), creating any that are missing (annotation tags get
  `Annotation Link` back-link, `Page`, and `Order` fields; the reference tag gets
  an always-created plain `Annotations` container field —
  `REFERENCE_ANNOTATIONS_FIELD_NAME`, not a CATALOG field), parses
  `/tags/{id}/schema` markdown for name→id, creates missing **enabled** fields
  with their catalog `dataType`, and seed-then-trashes the placeholder option
  needed to create empty Options fields. Returns `ResolvedSchema` (incl.
  `entityTagNames` and `annotationsFieldId`). Run as a sync preflight, so the
  first sync auto-bootstraps.
- **`prefs/schema-config.ts`** — `SchemaConfig { tagName, entityTags,
annotationTags, fields:[{key, name, enabled}] }`, persisted as JSON in the
  `schemaConfig` pref. `mergeSchemaConfig` reconciles a stored config against the
  catalog (fills new fields, drops unknown keys, trims names; blank field name
  stays blank) and fills blank/missing tag names with the constant defaults (tag
  names are always concrete, unlike field names). A blank field `name` means "use
  the catalog default" (grey placeholder), resolved at sync time.
- **`prefs/schema-panel.tsx`** — schema prefs UI: workspace dropdown, a name
  input for **every supertag** (Person / Organization / highlight / comment /
  image, then the reference tag), the **reference-node-title dropdown**, the
  per-field table (sync checkbox + rename + read-only type), and a **Create /
  refresh schema in Tana** button. Receives the (localized) title-format options
  as props.
- **`prefs/preferences.tsx` + `preferences.xhtml`** — token, parent node ID,
  optional Local API URL, sync-on-modify, collection table. The schema groupbox
  is **last**; preferences resolves the title-format options (Fluent labels +
  Better-BibTeX gating) and passes them into the React schema panel.
- **`locale/en-US/zotana.ftl`** — Fluent source of truth for every user-facing
  string (menu/pref labels, groupbox descriptions, progress + error text);
  check/edit here when verifying or changing UI wording (e.g. README accuracy).
- **`data/item-data.ts`** — stores `{nodeId, title}` + the annotation map +
  per-field signature map in a hidden Zotero link attachment (the upsert key).
  Both the attachment create (`linkFromURL`) and the note save (`saveTx`) pass
  `skipNotifier: true` (see decisions below).
- **`sync/sync-job.ts`** — builds the client from prefs, runs `ensureSchema`,
  maps title format, skips note items.
- **`sync/sync-regular-item.ts`** — the upsert (reachability check, per-field
  diff, warn-and-skip; see decisions below).
- **`sync/content-signature.ts`** — network-free signature of an item's synced
  _source_ fields (excludes `dateModified` / `year` / citations). The
  sync-on-modify path skips a sync when it matches the last one, so edits to
  non-synced or volatile fields don't trigger a pointless sync. `fieldSignature`
  lives here.
- **`sync/sync-config.ts`** — shared `getCitationFormat` / `getTitleFormat` pref
  readers (split out so `content-signature` doesn't import `sync-job`).
- **`sync/sync-annotations.ts`** — per-annotation upsert into `#highlight` /
  `#comment` / `#image` nodes, **nested under the reference node's `Annotations`
  field** (`schema.annotationsFieldId`), each carrying a `zotero://open-pdf`
  back-link in its `Annotation Link` field, a `Page` label, and an `Order` rank
  (`sync/annotations.ts` normalizes Zotero annotations to these). A scoped
  `ownedBy` reachability search recreates nodes the user deleted in Tana — nodes
  nested under the field stay recursively owned by the reference node, so the
  search is unaffected; `Order` is rewritten when an annotation's reading-order
  rank shifts (see decisions below).
- **`tana/reference-builder.ts`, `tana/entities.ts`, `tana/tana-paste.ts`** —
  item → reference node (base-field reads, six title formats, live CSL via
  `Zotero.QuickCopy`) → creator bucketing/routing → Tana Paste serialization.

The build toolchain (esbuild + vite-plus), Zotero scaffolding, and the
collection service are inherited from Notero. `services/sync-manager.ts` (the
debounce + the modify-path no-op skip) is Zotana's; see decisions below.

## Key design decisions

- **In-place per-field upsert** to preserve the Tana node's identity and inbound
  links. The Tana node ID is stored on the Zotero item.
- **Schema configured by name, resolved/bootstrapped at runtime** — no hardcoded
  workspace IDs; renaming a field in prefs (and in Tana) keeps the link working.
- **Every supertag name is user-configurable** (reference + Person / Organization
  / highlight / comment / image), stored in `SchemaConfig` and resolved/created by
  `ensureSchema`. `TanaLink.tag` stays the **logical** `EntityTag` key, NOT the
  display name: the update path keys off it to find the tag id
  (`entityTagIds[link.tag]`, writing entity nodes by-id), and the create paste
  resolves it to the configured name only at serialization via the node's
  `entityTagNames` map (`linkMarkup`). Keeping the key (not the name) on the link
  is what lets a rename work without touching the update path. The
  content-signature stand-in uses the **constant** entity names so renaming an
  entity tag doesn't churn every item's signature (the signature tracks item
  content, not schema naming).
- **Resolve-by-name; create-or-find, never rename.** `ensureSchema` matches every
  tag/field by its configured **name** and **creates** any that are missing — it
  has no rename op (the Local API's `addField`/`createTag` only create). It runs
  as a **sync preflight**, so a sync auto-bootstraps whatever's missing; the prefs
  **Create / refresh** button just runs the same `ensureSchema` on demand (to
  bootstrap up front or surface errors), it does nothing a sync wouldn't.
  Consequences for **renaming**: a name in `SchemaConfig` that matches an existing
  Tana tag/field → reused (identity/data/back-links preserved); a name that
  doesn't → a fresh tag/field is created, orphaning the old one. So a rename that
  keeps data must happen in **both** places: rename in the Tana UI (Tana keeps the
  object's id, so all nodes already tagged with it follow) **and** set the matching
  name in `SchemaConfig`. Renaming in only one place duplicates. (Existing
  reference/entity nodes are updated in place by node id and keep whatever tag they
  were created with, so a Zotana-only rename also yields a mixed old/new tag
  state — another reason to rename in Tana first.)
- **Entity fields (Creators / Editors / Contributors / Publisher) are Options
  fields written by-id via `setFieldOption`**, NOT `setFieldContent`
  (`setFieldContent` would store the node id as literal text). This reuses the
  existing `#Person` / `#Organization` node (no duplicates) and auto-collects a
  mixed-tag picker. The REST API can't create an empty Options field (400), so
  bootstrap seeds `__zotana_seed__` then trashes it.
- **Deleted-node policy = reachability, not read-200.** `GET /nodes/{id}` returns
  200 for live, trashed, AND orphaned-"ghost" nodes (404s only once fully
  purged), so a bare read can't tell a usable node from a dead one.
  `sync-regular-item` searches by tag + stored title and checks the stored nodeId
  is among the hits: reachable → update in place; unreachable (trashed / orphaned
  / purged all collapse here) → rebuild. **`/nodes/search` itself returns trashed
  nodes** (with `inTrash: true`, filed under "Deleted Nodes" — live-verified), so
  every reachability/usefulness check must drop `inTrash` hits, or a node the user
  trashed in Tana counts as "reachable" and gets updated _in place inside the
  trash_ instead of rebuilt. This guard lives in `nodeReachable`,
  `liveAnnotationNodeIds` (annotations), `resolveEntityNodeId` (entity reuse), and
  `isReferenced` (a trashed linker must not protect a field). The only search whose
  raw hits are used without the filter is `ownedNodeIds` (it's intersected with
  live value-node ids from a `readNode`, so trashed entries can't false-match).
- **Index-lag grace on reachability.** Tana's search index lags a few seconds
  behind a freshly created **or renamed** node, so a re-sync within that window
  (e.g. drop-to-collection auto-sync then a manual sync; or a title-format change
  then a re-sync) would search-miss the node and rebuild a duplicate — the
  reachability search is by node name, so a rename's lag bites just like a
  create's. Each node stores `createdAt` and `titleSyncedAt` (set on create,
  refreshed on every rename); a search miss within `INDEX_LAG_GRACE_MS` (30 s) of
  `titleSyncedAt ?? createdAt` is trusted (keep), a later miss is real (rebuild).
  Age cleanly separates "not yet indexed" from "no longer indexed" because lag is
  short/self-correcting and trashing is permanent — no `readNode` (it 200s for
  live/trashed/orphaned alike, so it can't disambiguate). Anchoring to the last
  rename (not just create) is what stops a title-format change from duplicating.
- **Per-field diff** — a `setFieldContent` replace trashes the prior value node,
  so an unconditional rewrite buried ~20 nodes in the Tana trash every sync. Only
  changed fields are written; only previously-set fields are cleared.
- **Reference-preserving warn-and-skip** — before overwriting/clearing a scalar
  value node, check whether other Tana nodes link to it
  (`search({linksTo:[valueNodeId]})`); if so, leave it and report the field in the
  ProgressWindow ("Synced with warnings"). Relies on `readNode` markdown carrying
  `<!-- node-id -->` comments (see Open work). **The same guard protects an
  annotation removed from Zotero**: before trashing its Tana node,
  `syncAnnotations` runs `isReferenced` (shared, exported from `sync-regular-item`)
  and, if another node links to it, leaves it untrashed, warns
  (`referencedAnnotations`, merged into the same ProgressWindow channel as
  `referencedFields`), and keeps tracking it so a later sync trashes it once the
  link is gone. (Annotation _updates_ need no such guard: name/description edits
  preserve the node id, so links survive.)
- **Entity nodes land in the workspace Library** (`{workspaceId}_STASH`); Tana
  files inline `[[Name #Person]]` refs there regardless of import parent, so the
  update path matches.
- **One `Annotation Link` field per annotation tag, resolved by name.** Each of
  `#highlight` / `#comment` / `#image` gets its **own** `Annotation Link`
  back-link field, because the Local API's `POST /tags/{tagId}/fields` only ever
  _creates_ a field (name + dataType) — there's no way to attach an existing field
  id to a second tag, and `ensureSchema` resolves each tag's field independently
  from _that tag's_ `/tags/{id}/schema` markdown. So three tags ⇒ three
  `Annotation Link` fields by design. A user **can safely merge them into one** in
  Tana: resolution is purely by name (`ANNOTATION_FIELD_NAME = 'Annotation Link'`),
  so as long as all three tags still carry a field literally named `Annotation
Link` (still a URL field) after the merge, sync keeps writing back-links to the
  single merged field. If the merge drops the field from any tag or renames it,
  the next sync's `ensureSchema` recreates a fresh `Annotation Link` on the tag(s)
  missing it by that name — reintroducing duplicates. Existing annotation
  back-links are unaffected
  either way: the back-link is written only at node creation, never on update
  (`sync-annotations.ts` updates touch only name/description).
- **Annotations nest under a reference-tag `Annotations` container field**, not as
  bare children of the reference node. The field is a plain field
  (`REFERENCE_ANNOTATIONS_FIELD_NAME`), always created by `ensureSchema` (it's
  structural, so it's not in the CATALOG and has no per-field sync toggle). **The
  field is one tuple node, and importing `[[^annotationsFieldId]]::` again creates
  a _second_ `Annotations` field** (live-verified — Tana does NOT merge repeated
  field imports by attribute id). So new annotations must be imported _under the
  existing field tuple node_, not via `Field::`. `sync-annotations` resolves that
  tuple id lazily and persists it as `annotationsContainerId` (`TanaSyncData`):
  the first create imports `Field::` on the reference node to make the field, then
  finds the new tuple via `getChildren(ref)` ∩ that import's `createdNodes` (the
  tuple is the only created node that's a _direct_ child of the reference — the
  annotation and its value nodes sit deeper); later creates import under the stored
  tuple so they append to the one field. A stored tuple the user deleted in Tana is
  detected (`getChildren` no longer lists it) and the field is recreated. The
  literal text/comment is still written afterward via `update` (highlight text
  carries Paste-significant chars). **Reachability is intentionally unchanged**:
  nodes nested under the field — or under a further sub-node the user adds _within_
  it — stay recursively owned by the reference node, so the `ownedBy`-scoped search
  still finds them (live-verified). (Moving annotations _out_ from under the
  reference node would break that search — but the field keeps them inside it.) The
  update path never re-parents, so annotations synced before this change stay as
  bare children (still owned by the reference node ⇒ still reachable, no
  duplicates); only newly-created/rebuilt ones land under the field.
- **Partial-date granularity** — emit `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD` from
  Zotero's multipart SQL date; no season→month padding.
- **Sync-on-modify = global debounce + content-signature no-op skip.**
  `item.modify` fires for _any_ edit, so the modify path compares
  `contentSignature(item)` (source fields only) against the last sync and drops
  no-ops before enqueuing. Surviving edits feed one **global** `SYNC_DEBOUNCE_MS`
  (5 s) timer — a single batched job across all queued items, serialized by
  `syncInProgress`; no per-item timers. A deselect-flush (sync on item-tree
  `onSelect`) was tried and **removed**: `onSelect` also fires on our own
  attachment writes, re-entering `performSync` and creating duplicate nodes.
- **Modify never creates.** The `item.modify` auto-sync path only _updates_ an
  item that already has a Tana node — `getItemsForNotifierEvent` filters out
  items with no stored sync data (`getTanaSyncData(item) === undefined`). Creation
  happens only via `collection-item.add` (drag into a synced collection) or a
  manual sync. This stops deleting the hidden "Tana" attachment — which makes
  Zotero fire `item.modify` on the parent, and which is the ghost-node recovery
  action — from immediately recreating the node; the deletion disconnects the
  item and a manual sync rebuilds it. (Non-"Tana" attachment edits were already
  no-op-skipped: the "Tana" attachment survives, so the content signature is
  unchanged. Only deleting the "Tana" attachment destroyed the baseline.)
- **`skipNotifier` on the sync-data attachment write — re-entrancy guard, at a
  cosmetic cost.** `saveTanaSyncData` creates/saves the hidden "Tana" attachment
  with `skipNotifier: true` (both `linkFromURL` and `saveTx`) so persisting our
  own sync data can't emit an `item.add`/`item.modify` that re-enters the sync
  and duplicates the node (same re-entrancy class as the removed deselect-flush
  and the `syncingItemIDs` guard). **Known cosmetic effect:** because the notifier
  never fires, Zotero's item tree doesn't redraw, so a freshly created "Tana"
  attachment doesn't appear under the item until the row is forced to re-render
  (collapse/expand, reselect, or library reload). The data is fully persisted;
  only the tree rendering lags. Left as-is deliberately — nudging the tree to
  refresh without routing through the subscribed notifier is possible but carries
  re-entrancy risk, so it's not worth it for a purely visual lag.

## The Tana Local API

- REST at `http://localhost:8262` (`GET /openapi.json`, "Tana Local API"); `/mcp`
  is just the AI-client façade. The Tana desktop app must be running with the
  Local API enabled and the target workspace loaded.
- **Auth gotcha:** the Local API needs a **Personal Access Token**
  (`type:"personal"`), created from Tana's **account settings (top-right)**. The
  cloud **"Get API Token" / "Make API token"** JWT is **rejected with 401** — do
  not use it.
- Key endpoints: `POST /nodes/{parent}/import` · `POST
/nodes/{nodeId}/fields/{attributeId}/content` · `.../option` · `POST
/nodes/{nodeId}/tags|trash|update|move` · `GET /nodes/search` · `GET
/nodes/{nodeId}` · `GET /workspaces[/{ws}/tags]` · `POST /tags/{tagId}/fields` ·
  `GET /tags/{tagId}/schema` · `GET /health`.
- `dataType` ∈ `plain | number | date | url | email | checkbox | user | instance
| options`. `instance` needs `sourceTagId`; `options` needs a non-empty seed.
- **Verified behaviors:** `import` returns created node IDs (the reference node is
  the created node whose `name` === the title); `zotero://` links are accepted;
  inline `[[Name #Person]]` dedups by **exact name**; Options fields auto-collect
  values; field-name emission is collision-safe (paste scopes field resolution to
  the applied supertag); REST `addField` creates **global** (not tag-private)
  field defs.
- **Search rejects boolean query params.** `/nodes/search` validates booleans
  strictly and 400s on the string `"true"` a GET query string carries (e.g.
  `query[ownedBy][recursive]`) — numbers like `limit` _are_ coerced, booleans are
  not. Omit the boolean and rely on the documented default (`ownedBy.recursive`
  defaults `true`).
- **Search defaults to the _focused_ workspace — always pass `workspaceIds`.**
  `/nodes/search` with no `workspaceIds` searches only Tana's currently-focused
  workspace (whatever the user last opened in the app), NOT the token's or the
  configured one. This is non-deterministic: with the wrong workspace focused,
  every reachability search misses → the node is judged unreachable → rebuilt as a
  **duplicate** (reference, entity, AND annotation nodes alike). So every
  `client.search` call in the sync path passes `workspaceIds: [schema.workspaceId]`.
  Entity/reference/annotation nodes all live in the configured workspace, so
  scoping is always correct.
- **Search returns trashed nodes** (`inTrash: true`, breadcrumb under "Deleted
  Nodes" — live-verified). A `hasType`/`ownedBy`/`linksTo` query includes nodes the
  user trashed, so any "is this node still usable?" check must filter `inTrash`
  (see the Deleted-node policy decision). Hard-purged and orphaned-ghost nodes do
  drop out of search; only trashed-but-not-purged ones come back flagged.

## Known limitations

- **URL fields (DOI / URL / Item / annotation back-links) are always written as
  plain text** — on create and on update alike. Markdown-link rendering on import
  proved unreliable (clickable for some fields/nodes, not others), so Zotana emits
  raw URLs and the user converts them with Tana's `Iterate and convert URLs to URL
nodes` command. (Also in README.)
- **Entity resolution** substring-searches with `limit: 50` and matches the name
  exactly client-side; an exact match beyond the first 50 hits is missed (rare).
- **Standalone note items are not synced** — `sync-job` skips `item.isNote()`.
  This is a non-goal, not deferred work: supporting it would need an
  HTML→Tana-Paste converter (Notero's `html-to-notion` is the reference). An
  item's own `abstractNote` still syncs as the abstract field. (Also in README.)

## Open work

- **v0.3.1 (2026-06-20).** Workspace-by-ID configuration + two duplicate-node
  fixes for title-format changes:
  - Schema panel: Workspace **dropdown → text field + Detect + on-demand picker**
    (the old dropdown loaded once at mount, went stale on a new token / closed
    Tana); sync resolves the workspace from the configured ID only.
  - **Every sync search now passes `workspaceIds`** — `/nodes/search` otherwise
    defaults to the focused workspace, so reachability missed and rebuilt
    duplicates (reference/entity/annotation). Primary duplicate cause.
  - **Index-lag grace extended to renames** via `titleSyncedAt` — a title-format
    change renames the node, and a quick re-sync within the index lag used to
    rebuild a duplicate; now it updates in place. Live-verified.
- **v0.3 landed + tagged (2026-06-19, PR #11).** Two annotation-sync changes,
  live-verified against real Zotero + Tana and released as `v0.3.0`:
  - **Deleted-annotation recovery.** `syncAnnotations` now does a scoped `ownedBy`
    - annotation-tag reachability search (one query) and recreates any annotation
      whose Tana node was trashed/deleted, instead of blindly trusting the stored
      node id (a trashed node returns 200 on update, so edits used to land silently
      in the trash and deletions never rebuilt). Mirrors the reference node's
      `nodeReachable`; uses a per-annotation `createdAt` + the shared
      `INDEX_LAG_GRACE_MS` to avoid duplicating a just-created node. Also stops
      re-trashing an already-gone node (which 400s).
  - **`Page` + `Order` fields** on every annotation tag (`ensureSchema` bootstraps
    both). `Page` (plain) = Zotero page label, written once at create. `Order`
    (number) = 1-based reading-order rank, rewritten via `setFieldContent` whenever
    the rank shifts (stored as `order` on the per-annotation record) so the user
    can sort by it — Zotana never physically reorders nodes (Tana's move op spawns
    duplicates). Image placeholder name dropped its `(p. N)` suffix; the page lives
    in `Page` now.
- **v0.2 fully live-verified + landed on `main` (2026-06-19, PR #7).** The complete
  live walk against real Zotero + Tana passed: create, in-place update, multi-item
  batch, sync-on-modify no-op skip, Title field, **Test D** (both trashed _and_
  purged nodes rebuild + attachment repoint), **warn-and-skip** (value node
  preserved; releases when the backlink is removed), **field-clear** (value cleared
  - node name re-renders), all **six title formats**, **group-library** items
    (back-links use `/groups/{id}/`), and **date granularity** (YYYY / YYYY-MM /
    YYYY-MM-DD). It also shipped two duplicate-class fixes — the in-flight guard in
    `sync-manager.ts` (`syncingItemIDs`, for the File-Renaming `item.modify` cascade
    that raced the contentSig persist) and the `createdAt` index-lag grace (both under
    Key design decisions) — the **annotation tags + PDF back-links**, and the
    **plain-text-URL** downgrade (Known limitations). Caveat: `linksTo` only indexes a
    reference made in the Tana UI, not one created via the API/Inbox. Not yet tagged
    for release (separate green-`main`-then-tag step; see `docs/RELEASING.md`).
- **Clean `tsc`:** `typecheck` reports errors inside `node_modules/@voidzero-dev/*`
  (vite-plus's own `.d.ts`); add `"skipLibCheck": true` to `tsconfig.json` if a
  clean run is wanted.
